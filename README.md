<h1>#Bootloader</h1>
<hr>

This is a fully working "bootloader" for x86 IBM-PC computers, with its main functionality being primarily to print some text on screen.

if you want to see this in action just run  

  ```
  bochs -f bochsrc.txt
  ```

I have coded this in assembly and used nasm and bochs
